#Q2.  Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a
#multiple of 5, between 2000 and 3200 (both included). The numbers obtained should be printed
#in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.
a = 2000

    if a%7 == 0 and a%5 != 0:
        numbers.append(a)
    a = a + 1 
print(numbers)

#Q3. Write a Python program to accept the user's first and last name and then getting them printed
in the the reverse order with a space between first name and last name.
